- DrummerViewController.swift in the Controller folder - this file contains the ViewController class that will connect our View created in Interface Builder to our Model.

- Main.storyboard in the View folder - this is where you will be creating your UI elements (buttons, labels, etc) and AutoLayout constraints. 

- Supporting Files - contains all the audio clips we'll be using
